# Amit_Embedded_Project
For this project, 2 Microcontrollers (atmega32) are used first one as master and other one is slave.
The folder for master is named"Group-F18" and for slave "SPI_slave".
The user inputs are either "TV_on","TV_off","Washer_on","washer_off". 
The user write the input in the virtual terminal and must type "#" so that the terminal knows the string has finished.
2 Leds connected at portA of the slave represent the TV and the Washer.
